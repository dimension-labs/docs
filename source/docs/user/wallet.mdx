# Connect a Wallet

## What You’ll Need

A compatible DSCC wallet: [DimensionLabs’s Signer](https://docs.dscc.community/docs/user-guides/SignerGuide.md). More wallets, including Ledger, are planned for the future.

## Sign In

You can access the wallet Sign In screen by clicking Sign In from the top navigation menu of DSCC.Live. Then follow these steps to sign in using the Signer app:

1. From the Sign In screen, click Sign In under the Dimension Signer option.

2. The Signer app window will open automatically. From the Signer window, when prompted to connect Signer to site, click Connect.

4. Now, you can change the connected account by using the hamburger menu of the Signer app if you like. Notice that ✔️ indicates the active account.
