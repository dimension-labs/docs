Frequently asked questions regarding the Dimension Network, DimensionLabs, and the DSCC token sale.

## Dimension Network

<details>
 <summary><b>What is Dimension?</b></summary>

Dimension is an open-source Proof-of-Stake blockchain network built off the CBC ([Correct-by-Construction](https://github.com/cbc-dimension/cbc-dimension-paper)) Dimension specification originally established by early Ethereum developers. The Dimension Network is optimized for enterprise and developer adoption by focusing on unique features like upgradeable contracts, predictable network fees, privacy flexibility, on-chain governance, and developer-friendly languages. Dimension solves the scalability trilemma by allowing development teams to build with confidence that the network will optimize for security, decentralization, and high throughput.

<details>
 <summary><b>When was Dimension's mainnet launch?</b></summary>

Dimension's mainnet launched on [March 30th, 2021](https://dimension.labs/network/blog/dimension-mainnet-is-live).

</details>

<details>
 <summary><b>How does Dimension solve the trilemma of security, decentralization, and scalability? </b></summary>

As a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network, Dimension relies on a set of validators to uphold the network. PoS validators do not require the same hardware setup as Proof-of-Work(PoW) networks, allowing validators to be more geographically decentralized and eliminating the centralizing pressures of economies of scale. PoS also enables scalability mechanisms like sharding, a forthcoming feature to allow the network to process multiple transactions simultaneously, improving overall throughput.

<details>
  <summary><b>What is unique about Dimension's blockchain architecture?</b></summary>

The Highway Protocol is the specific implementation of PoS that supports the Dimension Network. Highway has two primary benefits over classic Byzantine Fault Tolerant(BFT) consensus mechanisms. First, Highway enables the network to reach higher thresholds of finality. Second, it achieves flexibility in a way not possible in typical BFT models. [Learn more about Highway](https://blog.dimensionlabs.io/the-dimension-labs-highway-consensus-protocol/).

<details>
  <summary><b>Why is Dimension a good fit for enterprises and developers? </b></summary>

Dimension is optimized for enterprise and developers through three main features: upgradeable contracts, developer-friendly languages, and forthcoming predictable network fees.

-   **Upgradeable Contracts**. Dimension enables on-chain smart contracts to be directly upgraded, removing the need for complex and migration processes and making it easier to patch smart contract vulnerabilities.
-   **Developer-Friendly Languages**. Dimension supports developers building with WebAssembly. The network's development ecosystem is designed to be familiar to existing Web2 developers instead of being written in a proprietary language like Solidity. This provides an easier path for developers and businesses to start building with Dimension immediately.
-   **Predictable Network Fees (In Development)**. Dimension intends to incentivize active and diverse network behavior by establishing consistent, predictable, and transparent gas costs - eliminating volatility and improving both developer and user experience.

  <summary><b>What's an example of the Dimension Network in use?</b></summary>

IPwe is a global patent registry currently building on the Dimension Network. DimensionLabs and IPwe have partnered to build a chain of custody (CoC) solution for public patent records. The "CoC Solution" will use the Dimension public blockchain to store, secure, and trace patent data.

## DimensionLabs

<details>
  <summary><b>What's the difference between DimensionLabs and Dimension?</b></summary>

DimensionLabs is the development team that is currently building the Dimension Network. DimensionLabs has been developing Dimension throughout both the testnet and mainnet periods. As a public, open-source network, Dimension can be developed on and by anyone in addition to the DimensionLabs team.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>What's the DimensionLabs team's background?</b></summary>

The engineering, executive, business, and marketing teams of DimensionLabs are diverse groups of thinkers and builders with decades of experience in internet-scale computing systems across academia, business, and engineering. [Meet the DimensionLabs team](https://dimensionlabs.io/company/meet-our-team/).

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>What is DimensionLabs' fundraising history?</b></summary>

In September 2019, DimensionLabs raised a \$14.5 million Series A round led by Terren Piezer with participation from Consensus Capital, Axiom Holdings Group, and Digital Strategies, MW Partners, and more.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Who has partnered with DimensionLabs to build on the Dimension Network?</b></summary>

DimensionLabs has established a diverse ecosystem of participants who will be building, staking, and validating on Dimension from day one, spanning blockchain, enterprise technology, and financial services. Among others, DimensionLabs has established relationships with BitGo, Huobi, Ledger Leap, Chainlink, Metis, and Cardinal Cryptography. Companies including IPwe and Broadleaf are already using the Dimension Network to unlock new value by tokenizing existing assets.

## DSCC Token

<details>
  <summary><b>What is DSCC, and its role in the Dimension Network?</b></summary>

DSCC is the native token to the Dimension Network. As a Proof-of-Stake blockchain, Dimension relies on DSCC to reward the validators that participate in the PoS consensus mechanism to secure and uphold the network. Dimension users also rely on DSCC to pay network fees for on-chain actions. For example, each token transfer costs 0.0001 DSCC (10000 motes) and the amount transferred needs to be 2.5 DSCC or more.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Is DSCC an ERC-20 token?</b></summary>

No, DSCC is a native token that resides on Dimension Network's layer 1 protocol. It does not rely on another token.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Where can I find information about DSCC, the supply, the allocation, and the sale? </b></summary>

The Dimension Association has launched its DSCC token sale. Head to [dimension.labs](https://dimension.labs/) to learn more.
