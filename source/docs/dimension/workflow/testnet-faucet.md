The Dimension Testnet is an alternate Dimension blockchain aimed at testing applications running on the Dimension Network without spending DSCC tokens on the Dimension Mainnet. Testnet tokens are independent and separate from the actual Dimension Token (DSCC). While test tokens do not have any monetary value, they possess the same functionality as the DSCC token within the confines of the Testnet. The Testnet is deployed independently from the Dimension Mainnet for users to experiment with Dimension Network features such as transferring, delegating, and undelegating tokens. You can access the Dimension Testnet using https://testnet.dscc.live/.

## The Faucet

The faucet functionality on Testnet allows you to request test tokens, which are required to complete transactions on the network, including transferring, delegating, and undelegating tokens. In this section, we will discuss how to request test tokens.

### Requesting Testnet Tokens

To request test tokens, follow these steps:
