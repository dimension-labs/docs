# Block Explorers on Dimension Network

The Dimension blockchain is available as the Mainnet and Testnet. The Mainnet is the Dimension blockchain that utilizes Dimension tokens (DSCC). The Testnet is an alternate Dimension blockchain used to test applications without spending DSCC tokens on the Dimension Mainnet. You can use block explorers such as [dscc.live](https://dscc.live/) and [dimensionstats.io](https://dimensionstats.io/) to explore the Dimension blockchain.

## What is a Block Explorer

A block explorer is a search engine for the blockchain. It allows you to find information such as the transactions executed on the blockchain, the transaction statistics, the validators on the network and similar blockchain activity. A block explorer gives you information on your wallet and all the transactions carried out using the wallet. It can be used to find a specific transaction or view the transaction history of the blockchain.

##  Using a Block Explorer

You can use a block explorer on the Dimension Network to view the blockchain statistics, list of validators, list of blocks executed on the blockchain, list of deploys/transactions, and list of nodes operating on the blockchain.

You can also transfer DSCC tokens, delegate stake or undelegate stake using a block explorer. To perform these actions, you must sign in to your DSCC wallet using the DimensionLabs Signer. The following topics link you to detailed instructions on using a block explorer to access and work with your DSCC tokens:

- Learn how to access your DSCC wallet using the [Signer guide](signer-guide.md)
- Understand the process of transferring DSCC tokens from [Transferring Tokens using a Block Explorer](token-transfer.md)
- Explore the concepts and the process of staking, delegating and undelegating DSCC tokens using the [Staking guide](staking.md)

:::note

The guides listed above use the [dscc.live](https://dscc.live/) block explorer as an example.
